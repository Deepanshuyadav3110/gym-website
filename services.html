                <p>
                    At Klub 20, we understand that life can get busy and tiring. 
                    That is why we have so many different classes available to you from sun 
                    rise to sun set. In the recent years, yoga has gained a huge following 
                    and has increased in popularity. Many people are starting to practice yoga 
                    and are seeing the great physical and mental benefits. Yoga practice is a 
                    great way to strengthen the bond between your mind and your body. It is also 
                    a great way to learn to appreciate your body and its abilities. Our bodies 
                    carry us throughout the day, and yoga is about creating the opportunity to 
                    focus on our breathing, stretching and developing mindfulness.

                    This woman’s only section is a huge asset for us at Klub 20 because it is 
                    known that one of the barriers experienced by women includes discomfort or 
                    shyness when surrounded by many people working out. The women’s only gym can 
                    also be used as a transition into working out in the main gym. As many of our
                    new members are first-time gym members, this area is a perfect place to familiarize 
                    yourself with what a gym is all about. Note that everyone has to start somewhere, 
                    and it is never too late to improve your health! Klub 20 ensures that this area is 
                    only used by women by allowing access only through the women’s locker room. This 
                    area is equipped with the most essential machines for a full-body workout and also 
                    included a variety of cardio equipment and of free weights, kettle balls and mats.
