            <p>"Personal training gives you motivation to continue training. Some weeks it is hard to stay motivated. Our personal trainer Deepanshu has really kept us moving.
                Deepanshu is very personable and knowledgeable. If he does not know something, he checks with other trainers or health service providers that he knows and updates us with his findings. His cheerful attitude makes the training time go quickly.
                Each year I sign up for the rewari marathon and Deepanshu has been responsible for getting me through three of them. I am sure that he will give me the push that I need to complete the marathon again this year.
                Deepanshu has been an inspiration. His tales of his athletic holidays have challenged us to follow in his footsteps. he is always cheerful and while he pushes hard to get us to our goals, we have worked harder and longer only because of him."

            <P>"One month ago I started exercising with deepanshu as my trainer.
                Not having exercised for a long time I was apprehensive but when I met and got to know deepanshu I knew that he was the perfect coach for me.
                he is professional yet kind, patient and understanding.
                His encouragement has given me the confidence that I needed to start this program.
                After one short month I am pleased with my progress and feel assured that with him continued training and encouragement I would continue getting good results and attain my goal."

            <P>"I have been working with Deepanshu since May 2018. My goal initially was to lose weight.
                So faras of September 2018 I have lost 31 lbs and a total of 11.5 inches.
                This is all down to Deepanshu and his vast knowledge of fitness and dietary needs.
                During this time I have had a couple minor injuies to deal with and Deepanshu was able to adjust
                my program immediately and direct me to the proper professionals to help in my recovery. Looking forward to continuing
                to work with him in the future. Thanks Deepanshu!"
